## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-07

### 🏗️ Architecture Rewrite
- Complete rewrite with modular architecture matching Soplos Welcome 2.0
- Professional project structure: Core, UI, Config, Utils layers
- Separation of concerns for maintainability

### 🖥️ Universal Desktop Support
- Single unified codebase for all desktop environments
- **XFCE (Tyron)**: Full support with NumLock integration
- **KDE Plasma (Tyson)**: Native Plasma integration
- **GNOME (Boro)**: Complete GNOME compatibility
- Smart desktop environment detection

### 🔧 Display Protocol Compatibility
- Complete X11 support
- Full Wayland compatibility
- Automatic protocol detection

### 🌍 Internationalization Overhaul
- Migrated to GNU Gettext standard (.po/.mo files)
- 8 languages at 100%: ES, EN, FR, DE, PT, IT, RO, RU
- Keyboard mnemonics in all languages
- Automatic locale detection

### 🛠️ Enhanced CHROOT Recovery
- Improved partition detection (universal hardware/VM support)
- Full BTRFS subvolume support with hierarchical selection
- GParted integration for disk management
- Robust filesystem validation

### 🩹 Patch - 2025-12-08
- Normalized application switch styling across desktop themes (fixed oval/stretch issue in Live images)
- Applied focused CSS overrides and ensured application CSS has USER priority so widgets render consistently
- Prepared updated screenshots for the welcome flow (replace legacy images before packaging)

### 🩹 Patch - 2025-12-09
- Removed KDE bookmark remapping logic from the language changer; the language switcher now deletes `~/.local/share/user-places.xbel` before restarting the session so KDE/Dolphin regenerates localized bookmarks. This simplifies behavior in live images and avoids incorrect localized paths. (No backups; intended for live environments, documented as 2.0 preproduction.)
 - GNOME/Wayland display fixes:
	 - Robust GNOME Wayland resolution handling: improved D-Bus parsing of `GetCurrentState` with defensive unpacking and selection of logical monitors.
	 - Added GDK-first fallback to reliably detect the actual screen geometry at startup (avoids incorrect VM/guest mode detection such as `RHT`).
	 - Safer `ApplyMonitorsConfig` usage: pass empty property maps for monitor props to satisfy D-Bus signatures, increased D-Bus timeout to 5s, and prefer temporary apply method in Live ISOs.
	 - Selects best refresh rate when multiple modes match the requested resolution; improved error handling and debug logging.
